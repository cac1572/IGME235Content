# Concept
   It's like super mario with a sword. In this dark, post-apocalyptic ancient greek 2d side scroller, players have to invade
   Olympus to avenge the human race.
## Story
    In the time of the ancient Greeks, the gods became angry with humanity
    for their evils (greed, etc.) and so they decided to wipe the planet of humanity by
    spreading a plague. Nearly all people died, except for the playable characters, who had
    been blessed by Gaia, the Goddess of the Earth. These humans, infuriated by the death
    of humanity (for the most part) decide to travel to Olympus and wage war with the Gods.
    Zeus catches on to their plan, so the gods make a flying army to impede player progress
    to Mount Olympus. Their mission: fight through hordes of enemies and hunt down gods one
    by one, ending with Zeus.
